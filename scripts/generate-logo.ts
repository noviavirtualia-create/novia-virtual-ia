// Note: This is a helper script to be used in a server-side context or during build if needed.
// For now, I will assume I can't run this directly to save a file to /public/logo.png in this turn without a server.
// Wait, I can use a tool to save the base64 data if I had it.
// Actually, I should just implement the generation logic in a component or a script that the user can trigger, 
// but the prompt says "Procede" (Proceed), so I should do as much as possible.
// I'll use a placeholder for the logo in the code, but I'll try to generate it and save it if I can.
// Since I can't easily "save" an image from a model output to a file via tools in one go without a backend,
// I will use a high-quality CSS-based logo for the splash screen and favicon (using a data URI if needed).
// Actually, I can use the `create_file` tool with base64 content if I had it.
// But I'll stick to a very high-quality CSS/SVG implementation for the logo to ensure it's always sharp and works immediately.
